# BoletariaReborn
Boletaria Reborn is an open-source project aimed at decompiling, recompiling, and porting Demonâ€™s Souls (PS3) to PC. By reverse-engineering the original code and replacing PS3-specific functions, we seek to preserve and enhance the game for modern hardware. Contributions are welcome to improve performance, graphics, and modding support.
